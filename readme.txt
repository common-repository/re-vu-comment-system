Check the "Settings" or "Layout" section of your website to find where to embed codes. The process may differ depending on your server, so if you are having trouble, do contact your website's help desk. 

= 5.What is API and how do I use it? =  


An Application Programming Interface (API) key is a unique code which websites give to users who would like to use their API. Remember you shouldn't share your API key with other people. It works as a password for you. In order to prevent misuse, software developers can track who and how their API keys are used.


= 6.Help! I'm having safety or privacy issues! =  


Protecting your safety and privacy is a top concern for us. However, be sure to take the extra precautions of keeping your account details safe. One of the easiest ways to prevent any of your online accounts (including your Re-Vu account) safe is by making sure you have a good password that's not easy to break. Passwords which are at least 12 characters long, with numbers and symbols are the best. In case you do encounter safety or privacy issues, please [contact us](http://re-vu.com/contact_us).
